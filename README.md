# QtSerialPortComm
This is a simple example for work with serial ports in async regim.
If you want to use sync regim, remember that there are some bugs in library Qt4 for OS Windows(bugs had fixed in Qt5).

In current branch I use Qt 4.8

For work with Qt class QSerialPort in Qt < 5 you need to build and install it.
How do this http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Serial_Port (I fixed rus-vertion, it is correct now)
